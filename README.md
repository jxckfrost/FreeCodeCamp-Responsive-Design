# FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Design

This is my code for the FreeCodeCamp course that I take to further sharpen my programming skills, in the future I plan to redesigned it when I have deeper knowledge. For those new programmer undergoing the same course may use my code as GUIDANCE to help them with the course in thier own design. Thank you
